# Kubernetes and DevOps Homelab Project

This repository contains a series of projects designed to build hands-on experience with Kubernetes and DevOps practices. The projects progress in complexity, starting with simple Kubernetes deployments and advancing to more complex setups involving automation, scaling, monitoring, and resilience engineering.

Each project in this repository serves as a standalone exercise, providing clear goals and learning outcomes to enhance skills in container orchestration, CI/CD, infrastructure management, and cloud-native technologies.

## Project List

### 1. Deploy a Kubernetes Cluster using k3s or Minikube
- **Goal**: Set up a basic Kubernetes cluster locally using Minikube or k3s.
- **Tasks**:
  - Install Minikube or k3s.
  - Deploy a simple application (e.g., Nginx).
  - Expose the app using a `Service`.
  - Scale the application.

---

### 2. Deploy a Simple CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins
- **Goal**: Automate the deployment of an app to Kubernetes using Jenkins.
- **Tasks**:
  - Install Jenkins in Kubernetes.
  - Create a pipeline that builds and deploys a simple application.
  - Trigger builds automatically via GitHub commits.

---

### 3. Set Up a Kubernetes Dashboard
- **Goal**: Install and secure the Kubernetes Dashboard for cluster management.
- **Tasks**:
  - Install the Kubernetes Dashboard.
  - Set up RBAC for secure access.
  - Expose the dashboard externally using port forwarding or Ingress.

---

### 4. Deploy a Multi-tier Application (LAMP or MEAN Stack)
- **Goal**: Deploy a multi-tier application (frontend, backend, database) in Kubernetes.
- **Tasks**:
  - Deploy the application using separate Kubernetes `Deployments` and `Services`.
  - Store database credentials in `Secrets`.
  - Use `PersistentVolume` for data persistence.

---

### 5. Set Up Prometheus and Grafana for Monitoring
- **Goal**: Implement cluster monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Tasks**:
  - Install Prometheus to scrape Kubernetes metrics.
  - Deploy Grafana and set up dashboards to visualize metrics.
  - Create alerts based on resource thresholds using Prometheus Alertmanager.

---

### 6. Deploy an Ingress Controller and HTTPS with Cert-Manager
- **Goal**: Route traffic to services using an Ingress controller and secure them with HTTPS.
- **Tasks**:
  - Install an Ingress controller (e.g., Nginx or Traefik).
  - Set up Ingress resources for multiple applications.
  - Install Cert-Manager to automatically issue TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt.

---

### 7. Use Helm to Package and Deploy Applications
- **Goal**: Manage Kubernetes applications using Helm.
- **Tasks**:
  - Install Helm and use an official chart to deploy an application.
  - Customize the Helm chart configuration.
  - Create a custom Helm chart for a simple application.

---

### 8. Set Up GitOps with ArgoCD or Flux
- **Goal**: Manage Kubernetes configurations declaratively using GitOps.
- **Tasks**:
  - Install ArgoCD or Flux in the Kubernetes cluster.
  - Use a Git repository to manage Kubernetes resources.
  - Automatically synchronize changes between Git and the cluster.

---

### 9. Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
- **Goal**: Automatically scale applications based on resource usage.
- **Tasks**:
  - Deploy an application with resource limits.
  - Set up Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) based on CPU usage.
  - Configure custom metrics for autoscaling (e.g., using Prometheus).

---

### 10. Chaos Engineering with LitmusChaos or Chaos Mesh
- **Goal**: Test the resilience of your applications and infrastructure using chaos engineering.
- **Tasks**:
  - Deploy LitmusChaos or Chaos Mesh.
  - Create chaos experiments (e.g., kill pods, induce network latency).
  - Monitor application behavior and recovery during failures.

---

### 11. Service Mesh with Istio or Linkerd
- **Goal**: Manage inter-service communication and security using a service mesh.
- **Tasks**:
  - Install Istio or Linkerd.
  - Implement traffic management (e.g., canary releases, A/B testing).
  - Secure service-to-service communication using mutual TLS (mTLS).
  - Monitor traffic and service behavior using observability tools.

---

### Bonus Project: Build a Fully Automated Homelab
- **Goal**: Create a self-sustaining Kubernetes cluster with full automation and observability.
- **Tasks**:
  - Automate cluster creation using Terraform or Ansible.
  - Use GitOps (ArgoCD or Flux) to manage Kubernetes deployments.
  - Set up centralized logging using the EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) stack.
  - Implement node autoscaling and Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA).

---

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Docker and containers.
- Familiarity with Linux command-line tools.
- Access to a virtual machine (VM) or cloud provider (optional for some projects).
- Installed tools: Docker, kubectl, Helm, Terraform (optional).

## Learning Outcomes
- Kubernetes fundamentals (pods, services, deployments, scaling).
- CI/CD pipeline creation and automation.
- Infrastructure monitoring and observability.
- Application scaling and self-healing.
- GitOps principles and chaos engineering.
- Service mesh and secure service communication.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more complex applications (e.g., microservices architectures).
- Integrate with cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure).
- Experiment with advanced Kubernetes features like Operators and StatefulSets.
